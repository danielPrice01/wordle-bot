# wordle-bot

Program has two functions:
The algorithm can:
  A) Solve a randomly generated wordle word, assigned to the variable final_word
  B) Solve "your" word (that day's wordle word for example).

The algorithm plays the game in hard mode. If a letter is green, then any following guesses will have the green letter appear in the same location. If the letter is yellow, any following guess will include the letter in a different spot.
